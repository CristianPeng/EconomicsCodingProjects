### quantstrat

* ``quantstrat provides a generic infrastructure to model and backtest signal-based quantitative strategies. It is a high-level abstraction layer (built on xts, FinancialInstrument, blotter, etc.) that allows you to build and test strategies in very few lines of code. " 

* Follow the steps in the installation guideline pdf file (posted on the course webpage) to install quantstrat.




* Load the library:

```{r}
library(quantstrat)
library(quantmod)
```



Much of this lecture notes follow the book "Backtesting Strategies with R" by Tim Trice.

### A high-level overview

```{r, out.width="80%", out.height="15%", echo=FALSE}
download.file(url = "http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~zeng135/obmodel.png",
          destfile = "obmodel.png",
          mode = 'wb')
knitr::include_graphics("obmodel.png")
```


* The instruments contain market data (the time series of asset prices)
* The indicators are ‘features’ derived from the market data (feature extraction)
* Signals are generated through interactions between the indicators and market data
* Rules use the signals to generate buy/sell orders
* The interaction between rules and orders generates transactions


# Setup

### Settings and Variables

* First we set up the dates:
```{r}
startDate <- "2011-01-01" # First date of data to retrieve.
```




* Since we’ll be working with stocks in the U.S. market we need to set our currency object to USD.

```{r}
currency('USD')
```


### Symbols

\footnotesize

* You can choose to run the backtesting on multiple stocks:

```{r}
symbols <- c("BABA","AAPL", "MSFT")
```


```{r}
getSymbols(Symbols = symbols, 
           from = startDate)
```


* Tell quanstrat what instruments are present and what currency to use:

```{r}
stock(symbols, currency = "USD", multiplier = 1)
```

### Trade Size and Initial Equity

```{r}
initEq <- 1000000 #default initial equity in our portfolio
tradesize <- 100000 #default trade size
```

### What's in a name?

* Next we’ll assign proper names for our portfolio, account and strategy objects. 
* These can be any name you want and should be based on how you intend to log the data later on.
```{r}
portfolio.st <- account.st <- "testing"
```

### Initialization
\tiny

* We remove any residuals from previous runs by clearing out the portfolio and account values. 
```{r}
rm.strat(portfolio.st)
rm.strat(account.st)
```


* Now we initialize our portfolio, account and orders. We will also store our strategy to save for later.
```{r}
initPortf(name = portfolio.st,
          symbols = symbols)
```


```{r}
initAcct(name = account.st,
         portfolios = portfolio.st,
         initEq = initEq)
```


```{r}
initOrders(portfolio = portfolio.st)
```


* Create to strategy object:
```{r}
strategy.st <- strategy(portfolio.st)
```

# Indicators

### Indicators

* Market data is noisy. To gain insights from this data, we need to transform it through **indicators**. 

* The examples we will use are the 200-day and 50-day **SMA**. It is a basic average of the past n-day of the closing prices. Think about these indicators as smoothed prices. 

* We will also study RSI.


### Pick a stock to plot the indicator
\footnotesize

```{r, results = "asis" }
# plot the first symbol
stock_data <- get(symbols[1])
```
  

```{r}
head(stock_data)
```

### Trading rationale with VWAP

* We will implement the trading strategy with VWAP.
* But first we need to formalize the trading rationale with VWAP.

### Define the indicator function to be used

\tiny

* quanstrat allows users to define their own indicator functions.

* If you implement your own indicator function, you need to copy and paste it here, and run the function definition before including it into quanstrat. 

* As an example, we will use the mySMA function that we defined previously:

```{r}
myVWAP <- function(stock_data){
  stock_data$price <- (Cl(stock_data)+Hi(stock_data)+Lo(stock_data)) / 3
  stock_data$VP <- stock_data$price * Vo(stock_data)
  stock_data$total_vp <- cumsum(stock_data$VP)
  stock_data$total_v <- cumsum(Vo(stock_data))
  stock_data$VWAP <- stock_data$total_vp / stock_data$total_v
  x <- cbind(Cl(stock_data), stock_data$VWAP)
  names(x) <- c("price", "VWAP")
  return(x$VWAP)
}
```

```{r}
myPrice <- function(stock_data){
  Price <- Ad(stock_data)
  names(Price) <- "Price"
  return(Price)
}
```

### Plot the VWAP
\scriptsize

```{r, fig.keep='last'}
plot(x, legend.loc = "topleft")
```




### Adding the VWAP Indicator to Strategy

Adding an indicator in quantstrat has five parts to it:

```{r}
strategy.st <- add.indicator(strategy = strategy.st,
              name = "myVWAP",
              arguments = list(stock_data = quote(mktdata), 
                               n = 3),
              label = "VWAP")
```


### Adding the Price Indicator to Strategy
```{r}
strategy.st <- add.indicator(strategy = strategy.st, 
                             name = "myPrice", 
                             arguments = list(stock_data = quote(mktdata), 
                               n = 3),
                             label = "Price")
```

### Inspecting Indicator

\scriptsize

* The following is a quick way of inspecting indicators output:

```{r}
# apply the indcators to a stock:
testIndicator <- applyIndicators(strategy.st, mktdata=stock_data)
```


```{r}
tail(testIndicator)
```

# Signals

### Signals

* Signals are interactions of indicators with market data or other indicators. 
  - Essentially, they are used to determine when we will buy or sell one of the pre-defined assets in our portfolio. 

### Different Types of Signals

There are five types of signals found in quantstrat.

* sigComparison
* sigCrossover
* sigThreshold
* sigFormula
* sigPeak

### sigComparison signal
\scriptsize

* sigComparison: Signal continuously comparing two different quantities, returns a 1 if the relationship is true.

* For example: A sigComparison signal that will return 1 when price is above VWAP:

```{r}
strategy.st <- 
   add.signal(strategy = strategy.st, 
              name = 'sigComparison',
              arguments = list(columns=c("Price", "VWAP"),
                               relationship = "gt"),
              label = "price_above_VWAP")
```


* Notice:

1) The call to add.signal
2) The name of the strategy (strategy.st)
3) The name of the signal function (sigComparison for this first signal)
4) The arguments to the signal function, passed in as arguments=list(args)
5) The label for the signal which should be unique (and meaningful).
6) Relationship "gt" stands for "greater than". "lt" stands for "less than".

### sigCrossover
\footnotesize

* sigCrossover: The same as sigComparison but only returns value of 1 on the **first occurence** of the relationship changing from false to true.


* Example: a sigCrossover signal that returns 1 when price **first** drop below VWAP:


```{r}
strategy.st <- add.signal(strategy = strategy.st,
           name = "sigCrossover",
           arguments = list(columns=c("Price", "VWAP"),
                            relationship = "lt"),
           label = "price_x_below_VWAP")
```


### sigCrossover


* Example: a sigCrossover signal that returns 1 when price **first** move above VWAP:

```{r}
strategy.st <- add.signal(strategy = strategy.st,
           name = "sigCrossover",
           arguments = list(columns=c("Price", "VWAP"),
                            relationship = "gt"),
           label = "price_x_above_VWAP")
```


### Testing the signals
\scriptsize

```{r}
testSignals <- applySignals(strategy.st, mktdata=testIndicator)
testSignals[470:480,]
```

* Notice how the sigFormula sigal "longentry"" is determined.

# Rules

### Rules

* After constructing the indicators and generated signals based on those indicators, we add rules for those signals.

* There are 2 types of rules:
  - Entry: Buy shares
  - Exit: Sell shares and convert the shares into cash 

* We use **add.rules()** to determine the positions we take depending on our signals, what type of order we’ll place and how many shares we will buy.

### Turning on and off a rule

* In this rmd file, there are multiple rules for entry and exit.

* Each rule is defined in an R code chunk. 

* To turn it on, specifiy "eval = T" in the code chunk option, which stands for "evaluation = TRUE".

* To turn it off, specify "eval = F", which stands for "evaluation = FALSE".

### Entry Rule: SMA Crossover
\scriptsize

* Buy shares when price crosses above VWAP:

```{r, eval=T}
strategy.st <- 
  add.rule(strategy.st, name="ruleSignal", 
           arguments = list(sigcol = "price_x_above_VWAP", sigval = TRUE, 
                            orderqty = 1000, ordertype = "market",
                            orderside = "long", prefer="Open", replace = FALSE), 
           type = "enter")
```


* Notice:

1) The call to add.rule
2) The name of the strategy (strategy.st)
3) The name of the strategy function (this is usually “ruleSignal”)
4) The rule type (type), either “enter” or “exit”
5) The arguments to ruleSignal:

* The signal column (sigCol)
* the value that signals a trigger (sigVal)
* the order type (ordertype)
* the order side (orderside)
* to replace any other open signal (replace)
* The order quantity (orderqty)
* the preferred price (prefer)

### Exit Rule: VWAP Crossover

\scriptsize

* Sell shares when price falls below VWAP:


```{r, eval=T}
strategy.st <- 
  add.rule(strategy.st, name = "ruleSignal",
           arguments = list(sigcol = "price_x_below_VWAP", sigval = TRUE,
                            orderqty = "all", ordertype = "market",
                            orderside = "long", replace = FALSE,
                            prefer = "Open"),
           type = "exit")
```


### Apply Strategy
\scriptsize

* In order to run our strategy and obtain results, we must first call the applyStrategy() function:

```{r, eval=T}
out <- applyStrategy(strategy = strategy.st, portfolios = portfolio.st)
```


### Update

* Next, do the following (in the given order) 
1) update portfolio with transactions our strategy took
2) update account 
3) update ending equity

```{r}
updatePortf(portfolio.st)

daterange <- time(getPortfolio(portfolio.st)$summary)[-1]

updateAcct(account.st, daterange)
updateEndEq(account.st)
```

# Performance Analysis

Next, we look at all the trade statistics generated.



### Trading Statistics
\tiny

Only stocks with trades will show up in the statistics table!

```{r}
tstats <- tradeStats(Portfolios = portfolio.st)
tstats[, 4:ncol(tstats)] <- round(tstats[, 4:ncol(tstats)],2)
tstats_transposed <- t(tstats[,-c(1,2)])
knitr::kable(cbind(tstats_transposed, Average = rowMeans(tstats_transposed, na.rm = TRUE)))
```


### Trading Statistics Intepretation

**Num.Trades**: the number of trades that are done using the strategy. Each trade includes a transaction for buy and transaction for sell.

**Percen.Positive**: The percent positive statistic lets you know how many of your trades were winners. 

**Profit Factor**: Gross profit / Gross Loss. The amount of profit per unit of risk. The profit factor is how many dollars you make for each dollar you lose. A profit factor above 1 means your strategy is profitable. A profit factor below 1 means you should head back to the drawing board.

**Sharpe Ratio**: risk adjusted returns, $(E[r]- r_f)/\sigma$

**Drawdown**: A drawdown is defined as the loss incurred by an investment during a certain period of time, measured from its peak to its lowest point.


* For more intepretation of the performance measures:

### Transaction, Position, Cumulative Profit/Loss
\scriptsize

* The following code will plot the cumulative profit and drawdown for each stock. 
* You need to modify the code to plot your own indicator.

```{r, results = "asis",eval=F}
saved_plots <- list() # a list that saves the plot
for(symbol in symbols){

  cat("\n\n### ", symbol, "\n\n")
  
  stock_data <- get(symbol) 
  
  # Compute the SMA50 and SMA200, and overlay them 
  # on top of the price plot:
  # Price <- myPrice(stock_data, n = 50)
  # VWAP <- myVWAP(stock_data, n = 50)
  
  chart.Posn(Portfolio = portfolio.st, 
             Symbol = symbol)
         #    TA= c("add_TA(Price, on = 1, col = 'blue')", 
        #           "add_TA(VWAP, on = 1, col = 'red')")
  


 
  saved_plots[[symbol]] <- recordPlot()
}
```
